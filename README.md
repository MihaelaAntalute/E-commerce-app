After running the authenticate request, the client will obtain an access token that will be used in all subsequent request in order to authenticate the user and to authorize the user based on its role.

This is an example of what should be included in the request header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyIiwiZXhwIjoxNjcxMTQzMzEyfQ.dxIzsD9Bm8y_kw3MOoZ2JXIKOg--uZaA5XNtBLdGYc4Ps3nlzBFDwBJi0bEeHlCggonZ6nQ2zwCI0D5a7dXjmw
